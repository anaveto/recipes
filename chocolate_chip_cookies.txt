    tried adding a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed with 3 tbsp milk). tried preheating to 170 and baking there. ended up around 145 on the baking sheet or something like that at the end. 15 minutes at 170 convection. seemed like they were just barely starting to brown. i think it would be better to put directly on pizza stone maybe. they're good but super chewy which i'm not enamored by idk. just underdone, i''m putting them back in for a few minutes directly on top of the pizza stone and from now on i'm always putting everything on pizza stone. next time i'll do 170 like that directly on pizza stone

    tried doing wet and dry separate with 3 tbsp milk and combining before chocolate chips. looks like 3 tbsp milk might be too much. used real brown sugar instead of demerara which seems better. actually maybe 3 tbsp milk is ok it's a little stick now but will probably be good after refrigeration? i'll see. refrigerating overnight instead of just freezing. covered with saran wrap prior to refrigeration, which is a pain so probably just wet towel next time. put in refrigerator at 23:59 on 2023-07-03. preheated oven at 180 with convection for 1 hour. pizza stone on the very bottom of the oven with the baking sheet on the bottom rack so not actually touching pizza stone. pizza stone measured 175c after an hour when the oven was set to 180c, but after baking it measured about 165. bake for 14 min at 180 convection. when i took them out they were light brown but not dark brown. really nice shape after refrigeration and really whisking the wet ingredients separately for a long time. they look good, not sure about flavor. might have left them in too long? can't tell. it seemed like they were already slightly browning after like 7 minutes or something. maybe the temperature is actually ok? not sure. i'll try a bit lower on the temperature next time i think these are a little too brown maybe. the bottoms were fine like this even not directly touching pizza stone so that's good. they look pretty good tbh i'll see. kind of bread like tbh the whole top hemisphere has a crust the bottom is nice but the middle is pretty "chewy" i think it will be good with 170 maybe though yeah something like that

    only used 3 tbsp milk. added 1/4 tsp baking powder. used pizza stone on bottom rack. preheated to 200c convection. used freezer for 30 min with ball before portioning dough. didn't whisk wet ingredients separately which was a mistake. put chocolate chips in with dry which wwas a mistake. put baking sheet on pizza stone on bottom rack cooking with just the broiler since oven is top heating element only. used convection for preheating. switched to guittard semi-sweet chocolate chips. switched to using convection oven because non-convection just doesn't work with this thing. cooked on 185c convection but preheat was giga high like 210 or something so baking stone was over 180 degrees whoops whatever. did 14 min at 185. ended up a little overly browned i think to be honest idk. but at least the bottoms were cooked this time with the pizza stone. center still a bit undone.

    tried oatly barista and stork original baking spread instead of oil. did 14 min at 200. only baking soda no powder. did not chill dough. took them out once they were very very lightly starting to brown. used extremely tiny balls of dough. result was still raw in the center after 14 minutes, so put them back in at 210 for 3 more minutes. they were properly brown on the edges by that point, though still white in the center on the top. STILL FUCKING RAW KILL ME. back in for another 5 minutes at 210. still motherfucking raw. back in at 220 for 5 more minutes fucking kill me. pretty goddam brown all throughout by now but the center still seems not completely done. extremely flat cookies. giving up, going to buy a fucking pizza stone. still raw on bottom but crispy on top fuck
TODO (ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME TO ISOLATE VARIABLES)
    figure out temp/duration combo to cook completely
        try 210 at 14-17 minutes until they're brown all the way through but on the bottom rack
    do wet ingredients separately
    switch to refrigerating dough for 24 hours instead of freezing 30 min
    look through mama's recipe and try some stuff from there maybe
