Ingredients
    1 cup flour
    1/2 tsp baking soda
    1/4 tsp baking powder
    1/4 tsp salt
    1/4 cup sugar
    1/4 cup coconut sugar
    1/3 cup chocolate chips
    1/4 cup refrigerated milk
    2 tbsp refrigerated butter
    1/4 tsp vanilla extract

Instructions
    Preheat oven to 180 degrees
        210 on this piece of shit with baking stone on bottom rack and baking sheet on baking stone
        NOT convection
        MEASURE TEMPERATURE WITH THERMOMETER

    Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, sugar, coconut sugar with whisk
    Stir in chocolate chips
    Add milk, butter, and vanilla extract
    Stir until combined

    Put in freezer for 30 minutes

    Line one baking sheet and portion out eight small cookies

    Bake until edges start to turn golden (14 min)
    Leave on baking sheet for 15 minutes
    Transfer to cooling rack and cool for at least 5 minutes

LAST ATTEMPT
    did 14 min at 200. only baking soda no powder. did not chill dough. took them out once they were very very lightly starting to brown. used extremely tiny balls of dough. result was still raw in the center after 14 minutes, so put them back in at 210 for 3 more minutes. they were properly brown on the edges by that point, though still white in the center on the top. STILL FUCKING RAW KILL ME. back in for another 5 minutes at 210. still motherfucking raw. back in at 220 for 5 more minutes fucking kill me. pretty goddam brown all throughout by now but the center still seems not completely done. extremely flat cookies. giving up, going to buy a fucking pizza stone. still raw on bottom but crispy on top fuck
TODO (ONLY CHANGE ONE THING AT A TIME TO ISOLATE VARIABLES)
    figure out temp/duration combo to cook completely
        try 210 at 14-17 minutes until they're brown all the way through but on the bottom rack
    switch to refrigerating dough for 24 hours instead of freezing 30 min
    look through mama's recipe and try some stuff from there maybe
